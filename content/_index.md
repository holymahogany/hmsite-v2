## Holy Mahogany?

For my personal website, and for several other of my online personas, I've adopted the moniker "holy mahogany." To grok the significance of this phrase, we need just a little bit of art history.

László Moholy-Nagy (b. 1895 in Hungary, pictured below c. 1937 in Chicago) was a modern artist who's remembered today for his success not in one but many fields of art and design. He produced expert-level work in traditions as varied as painting, black-and-white and color photography, ad design, stage design, typography, and sculpture. But his most lasting contribution to the arts &mdash; in my opinion &mdash; was his teaching. He held an important position in the German Bauhaus (a small but influential school of modern art and design, est. 1919, forced to close by the Nazis in 1933), opened his own Bauhaus in Chicago (which, beset by crises of patronage, changed its name and location a half-dozen times), and authored a handful of ambitious art and design textbooks.

Like other modernists, Moholy-Nagy had a self-chosen name. He was born László Weisz. When László was young, his namesake disgraced the family and fled their home. Stranded, László's mother asked her brother for help, a man by the name of Gustav Nagy, a well-to-do country lawyer who lived across the Serbian border in Mohol. Gustav Nagy financed his nephew's education, so László, out of respect for his uncle, changed his name to Moholy-Nagy.

The trouble with choosing this very Hungarian name is that Moholy-Nagy spent most of his life outside Hungary. His colleagues had trouble pronouncing it and tended to replace it with nicknames. His peers in Germany called him "the constructivist" (because he was thought to be associated with the Russian avant-garde movement "constructivism") and when he came to Chicago he told the Americans that the British called him "holy mahogany" (English homonyms that approximate the original, pronounced "muh-hole-ee nahj"). 

The name "holy mahogany" is therefore meant to evoke the spirit of Moholy-Nagy. It is meant in particular to evoke his belief in the social responsibility of art and his distaste for artistic specialization &mdash; values which I have tried to embody in my art and scholarship.
