## About this site

I have had probably a dozen personal websites since undergrad. I tried Squarespace, Adobe Portfolio, Wordpress, and Webflow. The last iteration was built with a ruby-based static site generator called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. For the current iteration, I moved to a rust-based static site generator called <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>. (The transition was motivated by nothing other than a desire to try something else.) For hosting, I use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. The source code for this site is <a href="https://github.com/holymahogany/hmsite">here</a>. My images are hosted on <a href="https://imgbox.com/">imgbox.com</a>. I also use icons from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">fontawesome.com</a>. As a graduate student, I depend on free web services, the downside of which is that any one of them may decide to change their API and break my site. So, if something looks wrong, that's probably why!
